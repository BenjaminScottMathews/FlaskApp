# FlaskApp
A sample Flask web app to search movies and TV shows and discover more info about each

This was a project I developed while pursuing my masters at University of Southern California. I developed a small web app that allowed users to search movies and tv shows in order to learn more about them. The purpose of the app was to get used to quickly developing and deploying code using the Flask framework.

The assets folder includes my HTML, CSS, and JS while the Flask code is in the app.py file.
