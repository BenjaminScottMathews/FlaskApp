This is a small web app I developed while pursuing my Masters degree at the University of Southern California.

The goal was to gain expereince in quickly developing and deploying code using the Flask framework for web development. The app allows users to search movies and TV shows to gain more info about the sought out search results. We later uploaded the app to Azure web services.

My HTML, CSS, and JS files are in the static directory, while the Flask python code is contained within the app.py file.
